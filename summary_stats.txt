Excellent question. This is a classic and very practical data analysis task. Here is a detailed, structured approach to performing descriptive statistics on your dataset, moving from basic summaries to more insightful, combined analyses.

Step 0: Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

Before any analysis, the first step is to clean the data and create new, more useful variables.

Data Cleaning:

Check for missing values (e.g., a row with no Drugname or Total volume). Decide how to handle them (e.g., remove the row, or fill it if appropriate).

Check data types. Ensure volume columns are numeric and Month is a date/time format.

Sanity Check: For each row, does Approved volume + Denied volume approximately equal Total volume? There might be a third category like "Pending" or data entry errors if they don't match. Understanding this is crucial.

Feature Engineering (Creating New Columns): This is where you can derive powerful new metrics.

Approval Rate: This is the most important metric you'll create.

Approval Rate = Approved volume / Total volume

Denial Rate:

Denial Rate = Denied volume / Total volume

Year and Month_Name: Extract the year and the name of the month from the Month of prescription column. This will help in time-based analysis (e.g., comparing Jan 2022 to Jan 2023).

Phase 1: Univariate Analysis (Analyzing One Variable at a Time)

This phase gives you a fundamental understanding of your data's distribution.

1. For Categorical Variables (Drugname, Provider ID, Month):

Frequency Distribution:

Drugname: How many times is each drug prescribed?

Statistic: Count of each drug.

Insight: Identifies the most and least frequently prescribed drugs.

Visualization: Bar Chart of Top 20 Drugs by Prescription Count.

Provider ID: How many prescriptions has each provider issued?

Statistic: Count of prescriptions per provider.

Insight: Identifies the most active providers.

Visualization: Bar Chart of Top 20 Providers by Prescription Count.

2. For Numerical Variables (Total volume, Approved volume, Denied volume, Approval Rate):

Measures of Central Tendency:

Mean: The average value (e.g., average Total volume per prescription).

Median: The middle value. This is often more useful than the mean for skewed data like prescription volumes, as it's not affected by a few extremely large prescriptions.

Measures of Dispersion:

Min & Max: The minimum and maximum values (range).

Standard Deviation: How spread out the data is from the mean.

Quartiles (Q1, Median, Q3): The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values. This tells you where the bulk of your data lies.

Visualization:

Histograms: To see the shape of the distribution. For example, a histogram of Approval Rate will show you if most prescriptions are fully approved (a spike at 100%) or if there's a wide spread.

Box Plots: Excellent for visualizing the median, quartiles, and identifying outliers in one go.

Example Summary Table for Approval Rate:
| Statistic | Value |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Mean | 0.88 |
| Median | 0.95 |
| Standard Deviation| 0.15 |
| Minimum | 0.00 |
| 25th Percentile | 0.80 |
| 75th Percentile | 1.00 |
| Maximum | 1.00 |

This table would tell you that the average approval rate is 88%, but half of all prescriptions have an approval rate of 95% or higher.

Phase 2: Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis (Combining Variables for Deeper Insights)

This is where you answer your specific questions and uncover relationships.

1. Drug-Centric Analysis

Highest Prescribed Drugs:

By Total Volume: Group by Drugname and SUM(Total volume). This shows which drugs make up the largest quantity of prescriptions.

By Prescription Count: Group by Drugname and COUNT(rows). This shows which drug is prescribed most often, regardless of volume.

Visualization: Top N Bar Charts for both metrics.

Drug Approval/Denial Analysis:

Average Approval Rate per Drug: Group by Drugname and calculate the MEAN(Approval Rate).

Insight: Identifies drugs that are easily approved versus those that face scrutiny. Are certain expensive or specialty drugs more likely to be denied?

Visualization: A table or bar chart showing the drugs with the highest and lowest average approval rates.

Total Denied Volume per Drug: Group by Drugname and SUM(Denied volume).

Insight: Pinpoints which drugs are contributing most to the total volume of denials. This is a key metric for cost and therapy management.

2. Provider-Centric Analysis

Top Prescribing Providers:

Group by Provider ID and SUM(Total volume).

Insight: Who are your "power prescribers"?

Provider Performance on Approvals (Answering your 95% question):

Step 1: Group the data by Prescribing provider id.

Step 2: For each provider, calculate their aggregate approval rate: SUM(Approved volume) / SUM(Total volume).

Step 3: You can now:

Filter for High-Performance Providers: Create a list of all providers whose aggregate approval rate is > 0.95.

Identify Low-Performance Providers: Create a list of providers with rates < 0.70 (or another threshold). These providers might need education on insurer guidelines.

Visualization: A bar chart showing the average approval rate for the Top 20 providers (by volume). You can color-code the bars (e.g., green for >95%, red for <70%).

Provider Prescribing Habits:

Create a heatmap or a pivot table with Provider ID on the rows and Drugname on the columns. The values could be the SUM(Total volume).

Insight: Do certain providers specialize in or prefer specific drugs? This can reveal interesting patterns.

3. Time-Based Analysis

Overall Trends:

Group by Month of prescription and calculate SUM(Total volume) and MEAN(Approval Rate).

Insight: Is the total prescription volume growing? Are approval rates getting better or worse over time? Are there seasonal trends (e.g., more flu medication in winter)?

Visualization: A dual-axis line chart. One line for Total Volume over time, and a second line for Approval Rate over time.

Drug-Specific Trends:

Filter for a specific drug (e.g., "DrugX") and plot its Total volume and Approval Rate over time.

Insight: Is a new drug gaining popularity? Did an insurer policy change in June, causing the approval rate for a specific drug to plummet?

Summary of Descriptive Statistics to Perform (Structured Plan)

Here is a final, actionable checklist:

Part A: Overall Summary Statistics (The Big Picture)

Total Prescription Volume: SUM(Total volume) for the entire dataset.

Overall Approval Rate: SUM(Approved volume) / SUM(Total volume).

Key Metric Distributions: Generate summary tables (Mean, Median, Std Dev, Quartiles) and histograms for:

Total volume

Approval Rate

Part B: Drug Analysis

Top 10 Drugs by Prescription Count: (Group by Drugname, get COUNT).

Top 10 Drugs by Total Volume: (Group by Drugname, get SUM of Total volume).

Top 5 Drugs with Highest Average Approval Rate: (Group by Drugname, get MEAN of Approval Rate).

Top 5 Drugs with Lowest Average Approval Rate: (Same as above, but sorted ascending).

Top 10 Drugs by Total Denied Volume: (Group by Drugname, get SUM of Denied volume).

Part C: Provider Analysis

Top 10 Providers by Prescription Count.

Top 10 Providers by Total Volume Prescribed.

List of Providers with Overall Approval Rate > 95%:

Calculate SUM(Approved volume) / SUM(Total volume) for each provider.

Filter for results > 0.95.

List of Providers with Overall Approval Rate < 70% (or other threshold):

Same as above, but filter for low results.

Follow-up Analysis: For these low-performing providers, what are the main drugs they prescribe that get denied?

Part D: Time Series Analysis

Monthly Total Volume: (Line chart showing SUM(Total volume) per month).

Monthly Average Approval Rate: (Line chart showing MEAN(Approval Rate) per month).

By following this structure, you will not only calculate basic stats but also build a compelling narrative about drug prescribing patterns, provider behavior, and insurer interactions.
