This is the final piece of the puzzle. You have the raw methods and the optimized data structures. Now, you need the Algorithm Orchestrator.

To be efficient, we will not run every check on every page blindly. We will use a Waterfall Strategy:

1. Fastest/Most Reliable Check: XML Tags (Explicit structure).

2. Visual Check: Vector Grids (Lines/Intersections).

3.Content Check: Semantic Anchors (Keywords + Alignment).

4. Fallback: Images (Bitmaps).

Here is the complete, step-by-step implementation.


Step 1: Define the Master Container & Utilities
