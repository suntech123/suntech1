The METADATA_KEYS property of the PdfDocument object in the pypdfium2 library (the modern, maintained successor to pypdfium) is a tuple of strings that defines the standard keys used to extract metadata from the PDF's Information Dictionary.[1][2]
The keys contained in this tuple are:
Title: The title of the document.
Author: The name of the person who created the document.
Subject: The subject of the document.
Keywords: Keywords associated with the document.[1][2][3]
Creator: The name of the application (e.g., Microsoft Word) that created the original document from which the PDF was converted.[1][2]
Producer: The name of the application (e.g., Adobe Acrobat Distiller) that converted the original document into a PDF.[1][2]
CreationDate: The date and time the document was created.
ModDate: The date and time the document was most recently modified.
Trapped: A name indicating whether the document has been modified to include trapping information (often used in professional printing).[1][2]
How to Use It
You typically iterate over these keys to extract the available metadata from a document.[1][2] Here is an example using pypdfium2:
code
Python
import pypdfium2 as pdfium

# Open the PDF document
pdf = pdfium.PdfDocument("your_document.pdf")

# Iterate over the standard metadata keys
for key in pdf.METADATA_KEYS:
    value = pdf.get_metadata_value(key)
    if value:
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
[1][2]
Note: If you are using the older, unmaintained pypdfium library, the API might differ slightly, but pypdfium2 is the recommended library for working with PDFium in Python.[1][2]

Based on the list in the image, these are the methods belonging to the PdfDocument object in pypdfium2.
Here are the most commonly used functions from that list, grouped by what you would typically use them for:


1. Accessing Pages & Content
These are the functions you use immediately after opening a file to get to the actual content.
get_page(index)
What it does: This is the most important function. It fetches a specific page object so you can render it or extract text.
Usage: page = pdf.get_page(0) (Gets the first page).
get_toc()
What it does: Extracts the "Table of Contents" (also called Bookmarks or Outlines). It returns a structure showing the chapter titles and where they link to.
Usage: creating a navigation sidebar for a viewer.
get_page_size(index)
What it does: Quickly tells you the width and height of a page without needing to fully load the page object first.


2. Modifying the PDF (Merging & Splitting)
If you want to change the structure of the PDF file, these are your go-to tools.
import_pages(pdf, page_indices)
What it does: Copies pages from another PDF document into the current one. This is the primary function used for merging PDFs.
Usage: pdf_a.import_pages(pdf_b, [0, 1, 2]) (Copy first 3 pages of B into A).
del_page(index)
What it does: Deletes a specific page from the document.
new_page(width, height)
What it does: Inserts a completely empty, white page into the document.


3. Metadata (Information)
These functions help you find out "who, what, and when" about the file.
get_metadata_value(key)
What it does: retrieves a specific piece of info, such as "Author" or "Title."
Usage: pdf.get_metadata_value("Author")
get_metadata_dict()
What it does: Returns all available metadata (Title, Author, Creator, etc.) at once as a Python dictionary, saving you from asking for them one by one.
get_version()
What it does: Returns the PDF version (e.g., 1.4, 1.7). This is useful to know if a file uses newer features that older readers might not support.


4. Saving & Closing
save(dest)
What it does: Writes your changes to a file. If you imported or deleted pages, nothing actually changes on your hard drive until you call this.
Usage: pdf.save("final_document.pdf")
close()
What it does: Frees up the memory used by the PDF. This is important in scripts that process thousands of files to prevent your computer from running out of RAM.
Note on Forms (Advanced)
init_forms() is also visible. You only need this if you plan to read or fill out interactive PDF forms (checkboxes, text fields). If you just want to read standard text/images, you can ignore it.
