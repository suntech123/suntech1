Extract Primary Text Alignment (The Body Column):
For all lines that match the body_font_size, collect their x0 (left edge) and x1 (right edge) values.
Calculate the Mode or 5th Percentile of x0. This represents the true, dynamic left margin of the body text.
Calculate the Mode or 95th Percentile of x1. This is the true right margin.
